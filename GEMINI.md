This is a NixOS configuration project.

### Project Overview

This repository contains the NixOS configuration for a user named "miguel". It uses `home-manager` to declaratively manage the user's environment. The configuration is structured to separate system-level settings (`configuration.nix`), user-specific settings (`home.nix`), and package installations (`packages.nix`). The user's environment is customized for development and gaming, with specific configurations for `vim`, `git`, `tmux`, and the `foot` terminal.

### Building and Running

To apply the configuration to a NixOS system, you would typically run the following command from the root of this repository:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

This command will build the new system generation and activate it.

### Development Conventions

*   **Modularity:** The configuration is broken down into logical files. System-wide configuration is in `configuration.nix`, user-specific configuration is in `home.nix`, and packages are defined in `packages.nix`. Further user-specific application configurations are in the `home/` directory.
*   **Home-Manager:** User-level packages and dotfiles are managed with `home-manager`.
*   **Secrets:** There are no apparent secrets managed in this repository. In a more complex setup, you might use a tool like `agenix` or `vault-sops` to manage secrets.

### Key Files

*   `configuration.nix`: The main entry point for the NixOS system configuration. It imports other configuration files and defines system-level settings like the bootloader, networking, and system services.
*   `home.nix`: The main entry point for the user's `home-manager` configuration. It imports user-specific configurations for various programs.
*   `packages.nix`: This file lists all the packages that are to be installed for the user.
*   `home/`: This directory contains the specific configurations for various applications like `vim`, `git`, `tmux`, and `foot`.
*   `hardware-configuration.nix`: This file is generated by the NixOS installer and contains the hardware-specific configuration for the system.

### Usage

This directory is intended to be used as a complete, declarative configuration for a NixOS system. By modifying the `.nix` files, a user can add or remove packages, change system settings, and customize their environment. The changes can then be applied by running the `nixos-rebuild` command.
